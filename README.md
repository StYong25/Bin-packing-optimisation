Delivery box packing optimisation with implementation of First-Fit and Next-Fit algorithms

The bin packing problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem that includes packing 
items of varying sizes into a finite number of bins of fixed capacity. The main goal is to minimize 
the bins number used to pack all the items. In this project, the chosen real-life example that is 
associated with bin-packing problem is the optimization of delivery box packing for an e-commerce 
business specializing in skincare products. The objective is to efficiently pack different-sized 
skincare products into the smallest possible number of delivery boxes, hence reducing packaging 
costs and minimizing waste. 

Proposed Solution 
In this report, Array List and Tree Map are the data structures used to manage the storage of bins 
and items, whereas First Fit (FF) and Next Fit (NF) are the packing algorithms implemented and 
evaluated to solve the bin-packing problem. Specifically, the Array List is paired with the First Fit 
algorithm, while the Stack is paired with the Next Fit algorithm, to analyze the performance of each 
combination in terms of packing efficiency.
